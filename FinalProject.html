    <h1> Final Project</h1>
    <p>  The program I decided to create is a game for entertainment called Catch The Stars.<br>
        How to Play: Press the space bar to catch the drifting stars<br>
        and once you catch 50% of the total stars the game is over.<br>
        
      <p>  Incorporated in the game is a pause button as well as a timer<br>
          and a score tracker. The scene is set during the night and the point<br>
          of the came is to catch the stars as they drift away. I had gotten the idea from a mix of hoppy beaver<br>
          as well as the frogger game. Included some aspects like the pause and timer and score limit to reach.<br>
