    <p> My name is Ariel Tavares. I'm a junior Fashion Merchandising and Design Major with a Minor in Communication Studies.<br>  Im from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. 
        
        I'm the Public Relations chair for Uhuru Sasa, which was the first multicultural organization established at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
        <br>Some hobbies I have include traveling, designing and sewing clothing, reading, painting, and cooking/baking different things.<br>
        Once graduated, my goal is to gain experience in a clothing brand and learn how they work on their own.
        <br>Then I would own my own apparel line and buisness.</p>
